# react2coderstest App
## Introduction

This is a **Reactjs Application** built with a paginated list of the most popular movies as its main screen and a secondary one that shows more data about a selected item. It looks like this:

![Movie List](public/movie_list_1.png)

![Movie Detail](public/movie_detail.png)
